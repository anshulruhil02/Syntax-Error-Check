# C++ Syntax Analysis and Symbol Table Management

## Introduction
This repository contains a C++ application that performs syntax analysis and manages symbol tables for a given input script. The program builds a parse tree, traverses it to check for syntax errors, and maintains symbol and procedure tables to manage variable and function declarations.

## Features
- Parse tree construction from input lines.
- Syntax error detection and reporting.
- Symbol table management for variable declarations.
- Procedure table management for function declarations and checks.
- Type checking and propagation through the parse tree.

## Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need:
- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C++ libraries
